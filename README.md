# sq3px

The work «sq3px» is an interactive installation, which reacts to the lighting situation in the room – and thus also to persons.

Four sensors are attached to a stand at various positions, which measure the ambient light. A software, on a micro controller, controls nine electric motors through the resulting data. Depending on the brightness in the room, the motors move by up to half a turn. A wire is attached to each axis of a motor. These vibrate with small rotary movements creating a quiet crackling. In addition, a tablet PC is connected to the micro controller. A custom software on this PC translates the sensor data into a minimalistic graphic representation.

The installation is continuous in a slight movement – like blades of grass in the wind.
